# Python PLEXOS API
https://github.com/EnergyExemplarNorthAmerica/Python-PLEXOS-API

A repository of simple Python examples for use with the PLEXOS API. **This branch for 
PLEXOS 9 is still in progress.** Please note that this repository is not a supported
product of Energy Exemplar, but rather a help to the user which is a free time activity
for dedicated fans of the product.

# PLEXOS® for Power Systems
PLEXOS® Integrated Energy Model (PLEXOS) is tried-and-true simulation software that
uses state-of-the-art mathematical optimisation combined with the latest data
handling and visualisation and distributed computing methods, to provide a 
high-performance, robust simulation system for electric power, water and gas that is 
leading edge yet open and transparent. PLEXOS meets the demands of energy market
participants, system planners, investors, regulators, consultants and analysts alike 
with a comprehensive range of features seamlessly integrating electric, water, gas 
and heat production, transportation and demand over simulated timeframes from minutes
to 10’s of years, all delivered through a common simulation engine with easy-to-use 
interface and integrated data platform. 

PLEXOS is the fastest and most sophisticated software available today, and also the
most cost-effective.

# PLEXOS Licensing
PLEXOS® licensing is *not* included with the license for these examples. These
scripts are therefore only useful to those with current PLEXOS licensing. 
Furthermore, these scripts are *NOT* a supported part of the PLEXOS software. They
are only illustrative of uses that could be made of the PLEXOS API by PLEXOS
licensees.

# Development Environment
The authors are primarily using Anaconda Python version 3.6.x along with the PythonNet
repository, along with PLEXOS Desktop 9.0R03. 

*PLEXOS 9 API requires an additional set of software components to interoperate with Python.
In the Energy Exemplar download portal, this is called "API 9.000 R03". This library is 
PLEXOS version specific.*

The authors also use Visual Studio Code with the Python and GitExtensions VSCode extensions.

Also .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher is needed. However, you would have to install 
this to use PLEXOS.
