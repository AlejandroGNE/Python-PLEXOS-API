# Solution Files
PLEXOS(R) solution files contain the results of PLEXOS simulations. Constructing reports 
based on these results is a common API activity.

The scripts herein use a combination of pandas, sqlite3, and the PLEXOS API to construct 
such reports and the extensibility to construct further reports.
